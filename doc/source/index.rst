PyPR is an abbreviation for Python Pattern Recognition. The implementation of PyPR was done as part of an Ph. D. project, "Mining of Ship Operation Data for Energy Conservation", which purpose was to develop statistical models for analyzing the dynamics of ocean-going vessels, especially with regard to modelling fuel effciency.
However many of the methods used can be used in a wide range of application, and have therefore been collected in this library.
