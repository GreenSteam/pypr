Getting PyPR
============

PyPR is written in Python, and requires NumPy and SciPy. It should work with Python versions 2.5 and 2.6.

The code is still in its early stages, but for convinience the code has been released in a compressed file.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pypr/files/


The repository can be found at souceforge. To check out the current code::

    svn co https://pypr.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pypr/trunk pypr


There is a README.txt file with copyright and contact information.

To install PyPR run the following command::

    sudo python setup.py install

If the installation is successful, you should now be able to use PyPR.
This install assumes that your system uses ``sudo`` - adjust accordingly.
There is an ``examples`` directory where you could start.
